DITz is an open source DIT software project that helps you injest footage and media like Video, audio and photos, much like offshoot, with simple ui and custom file naming and folder structuring

The current feature roadmap is
- auto-proxie footage generation using ffmpeg
- automatic uploading of footage to the cloud (like dropbox)
- automatic prioritisation of uploading proxies over raw footage
